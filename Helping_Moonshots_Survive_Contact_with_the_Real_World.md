Moonshots: everyone thing is someone else's job. Big guys: "we can't do it, we're too big to risk it". Small guys: "we can't do it, we're too small, no resources to risk it". Gov: "we did it in the 70s, we're not doing it anymore". Academics: "we do the science, you go build it".

But, everyone can work on moonshots.

Their blueprint of moonshot creation is the intersection of Huge Problem + Radical Solution + Breakthrough Technology

Some projects:
 - Massive Neural Network project is what graduated as Google Knowledge into the main Google infrastructure.
 - Flying Wind Turbines!!! (Did I hear this right?)
 - Project Smart Less: contact lenses that sense glucose levels to help diabetics.
 - Project Wing: self-driving flying vehicles for delivery, i.e. drone delivery.
 - Project Loon: balloons in stratosphere building a data network mesh to bring Internet everywhere. Right now they are way ahead of the first prototypes and into a viable venture. Balloons can stay flying for 6 months and they can steer them to a pretty accurate location if needed.
 - Self-Driving Car: humans cannot be a backup system for the computer if you factor in human nature, because once you get into the car, you completely stop paying attention to the driving. That's why they removed the steering wheel, to remove the temptation of human backup. The small self-driving car concept will go on the streets this summer.
 - Google Glass graduated from GoogleX, is making progress, we will hear more in the future. There was a confusing message when prototyping, putting it out in the world caused the impression it was a finished product when it was not.

**Get contact with the real world as fast as possible.**
This is the key, you go out fast, face the actual use, fail fast, or adapt early.
Most of the stuff do NOT work, but this is part of the iterative process of innovation. Failing is fine as long as you set everything up as an experiment with a hypothesis.
They have a team of NEGATIVE EXAMPLES creation, to force reality to hit faster. To accelerate the rate of failure mode. Basically a 'chaos monkey approach' to everything.

Moonshots have a business model in the back, but it is a very long term one, not a detailed business model, more like a conceptual setup that shows there's potentially added value to Google in the long run.

Very interesting Q&A: engineering-only is not enough, awesome to have strong engineering culture but they took a lot of very valuable feedback from other teams of the organization. Cross-functional approach.

Brilliant answer about how to finance this: everyone working on a project (normal one, not moonshot) that is going to be a failure knows it within weeks, but just refuses to accept it. What if we would have a culture were saying "LET'S JUST STOP THAT" would be normal? You would save a lot of money!
