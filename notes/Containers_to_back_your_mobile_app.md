 - Define desired state (e.g. I want 4 replicas), kubernetes takes care of maintaining that true, i.e. if one dies, it will restart another one.
 - Services: does load balancing
 - Google Container Engine: hosted kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform
 - This is basically running Docker containers, i.e. all docker images can be run directly
