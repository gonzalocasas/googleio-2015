# Peter Norvig on data driven course building

- How to measure? Pre-course questionnaire as baseline of what to expect. 94% achieved results, but that does not mean class finished, it means class provided what student wanted.
- Skill mapping instead of sequential teaching: better match, dynamically adjust to student.
- Built on top of App Engine: REST endpoints, MapReduce built into it
- AI could be used to build skill maps and make the class dynamically adjust by itself
- Class builder open sourced
