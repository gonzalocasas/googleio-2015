# Grow your app user base with Search

 - App Indexing, not huge changes but Google Webmaster Tools has changed, we need to verify the app to see the new reports (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6178045?authuser=1)
 - Voice Actions: can add a intent-filter action SEARCH_ACTION to hook into system voice search, e.g. "search casa ferlin in local.ch" would trigger search directy in the app
 - Use ld+json on web to appear on rich card inside google search results and link up Google App Index
 - Search Console for analytics (not clear if there's much new stuff there)

(pretty weak talk BTW)
