"It's an opinionated implementation of the Material Spec"
Small JS/CSS material design 'library'
Not replacing Polymer at all
Only the things that might be relevant to content sites
Three parts:
 - Styles: palettes, shadows, typography
 - Components: buttons (flat, raised, FAB with ripples), switches, text fields + error messages, tabs, menu dropdown)
 - Templates

Responsive, focused on performance (60fps)

Check Adaptive UI (grid system for Material Design)
New release of Material Design Icon Set available
To be open sourced end on June: http://getmdl.io (link does not work atm)
Will also have a customizer to do things like add branding colors and get a bundled version of it
