## Project Soli

Started highlighting issues about human interaction: Fit's law shows limits of screen size for human interaction
Smartwatch screens are on the limit. ATAP is exploring how to reduce this tension.

 - Decouple the motion (gestures) from the actual device, i.e. scroll in the air to scroll your device.
 - Using your hand, means your own hand surfaces give you 'real haptic feedback'
 - Your hand is a complete self-contained user interface control. And, very, very ergonomic.
 - All physical controls replaced by your hands.
 - Sensing using radar is perfect, but too big.
 - The Gesture Radar: 1cmx1cm sensor to sense motion of your finger and hands in 3D space with high precision.
 - Tracks changes in radar signal and calculates hand position out of it.
 - Tracking info is fed to machine learning algo that does gesture tagging, i.e. recognition.
 - Available via APIs!!!
 - Awesome mini demos of the technology: 
   - Used two fingers to control a virtual 'watch crown'
   - Configured watch time in 3D space
 - Release later this year

## Project Jacquard
 - Multi touch textiles
 - Make existing garment interactive, adjust to the existing garment industry
 - Conductive threads: they had to invent them. Conductive wire interweaved with normal silk, can be of any color.
 - How can you weave interactive textiles to connect them to electronics.
 - Textiles, you wouldn't call them a wearable, you would call it...a jacket :P
 - We want it to be a raw material. Partnered with Levi's: "85% cotton, 15% project jacquard"
 - There's a tension between the need to interact with the real world and the digital world (i.e. texting others instead of eye contact with your company) -> the challenge is to release some of that tension with interactive textiles.

## Authentication
 - Humans are a bad source of enthropy
 - You are your password: multi-modal authentication model = leverage various sensors to authenticate you without tapping PINs, passwords, fingerprints, etc.
 - Project Abacus: 40TB data research set of phone sensors -> proved the hypotesis that authentication can be done this way.
 - A more secure authentication with less friction and NO hardware! Only a software update!
 - Project Vault:
   - Hardware and software isolated environment the size of MicroSD card. Security primitives and security-related computing and storage device. A sort of HW authentication key on steroids. 
   - A "digital mobile safe". It is an actual computer with an real time OS and an OpenRISC 1200 processor.
   - Is fully open source, including most of the hardware!
   - SDKs to be released soon (today?).

## Google Spotlight Stories
  - A new format, a new medium of expression.
  - An SDK! Story Development Kit
  - Immersive, interactive 360 movies
  - You can look around in any direction during the movie, and audio does virtual surround to your headphones. All processed on real time on your mobile device.
  - This week launching Google Spotlight Stories for Android. iOS to follow soon. By summer, the interactive viewer will be integrated on YouTube mobile app.

## Project ARA
 - The project seems to be moving forward to industrial process
 - Prototype is fully functional, today demoed assembling one, and booting Android L.
 - Modules are hot pluggable!! Plugged a camera module, camera app picked it up in about 3 to 5 seconds and was ready to shot.
