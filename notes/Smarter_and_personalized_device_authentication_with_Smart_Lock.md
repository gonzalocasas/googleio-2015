# Smarter and personalized device authentication with Smart Lock

 - Trusted voice for context: "Ok Google, navigate home" knows who is talking hence whose 'home' it means
 - On-body detection: uses acceleromenters to detect phone is still on you so don't need to unlock it
 - Your phone = your key = your identity! they are working to make the phone literally be the keys to the physical world
 - Smartlock can unlock your Chromebook
